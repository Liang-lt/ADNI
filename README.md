# A Quantitative Approach for Evaluating Disease Focus and Interpretability of Deep Learning Models for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification

This repository contains the code for our research on the classification of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using deep learning models, including a novel Disease-Focusing (DF) Score that quantifies model interpretability with a focus on brain regions pathologically associated with AD. This project also includes the evaluation of machine learning models based on volumetric features extracted from MRI data using segmentation techniques.

The code will be released after final testing and code documentation is complete.
